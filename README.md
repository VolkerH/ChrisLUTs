# ChrisLUTs

Due to popular request (well at least [@AbAttacks](https://twitter.com/AbAttacks/status/941068029433180160)), here are the LUTs I've generated for ImageJ.

Right now there are three groups:
* 3color are three-color LUTs that are made to be complementary (ie BMR/RMB vs YGC/CGY have non crossing paths along the RGB cube). I use them for "two-channels rainbow images", i.e. encode two channels each with a distinct "half-rainbow" map.
